# typescript-crud-basiclayout

## Clone repository
```bash
cd [Move the clone to a directory of your want]
git clone https://github.com/Taeho0927/typescript-crud-basiclayout.git
```  
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash

npm start
# or
yarn start

```

 

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8001](http://localhost:8001) with your browser to see the result.

++ It's just a layout, any further implementation is your role.
++  I am also planning on making a socket server with TypeScript.
